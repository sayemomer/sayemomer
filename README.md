### Hello, I'm Omer Sayem ðŸ‘‹

As an Applied Computer Science graduate student at Concordia University, I specialize in Data, Machine Learning, and Infrastructure. With 2+ years of experience developing data products, I am passionate about building intelligent data-driven solutions. My work includes leveraging AWS to process large-scale data, develop machine learning platforms, and implement robust search engines with Elasticsearch.

Currently, I'm diving deep into Machine Learning and aspire to create impactful data products.

My experience ranges from working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Markopolo.ai, where I processed large volumes of data and developed ML platforms, to FullStack Software Engineering roles where I built efficient search services and log monitoring systems.

I am skilled in Kubernetes, Computational Mathematics, and Distributed Systems. Proficient in Python, Java, and JavaScript, and technologies including AWS, ElasticStack, and Docker.

Reach out to me on LinkedIn for collaborations or discussions.

Happy exploring!
